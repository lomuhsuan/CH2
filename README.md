# PhoneKey Introduction

Established in 1995, UserStar Information System is a dedicated system integration company which has built its reputation by offering users friendly solutions. Since 2004, we have not only developed an anti-counterfeiting solution which can be used in mobile phones as readers, but also issued “active variable verification” and “expired identification technology” patent in more than 20 countries. With the widespread of NFC and Bluetooth mobile phones, we also launch RFID anti-counterfeiting solution and product.

Since it’s long been proclaimed that NFC-enabled mobile phone is going mainstream, we adopt the active variable verification technology into intelligence lock, make them be activated by mobile phones and also secure the wireless communication safety, which is guaranteed to protect vehicles from theft. When we released our first NFC and Bluetooth intelligence lock, PHONEKEY platform concept has been developed at the same time.
